## Project Library Management

To keep things as simple as possible the project library uses a simple file structure:

  - `projects/`
      - `project_name/` Append .ignore to ignore the project.
	      - `images/`
		      - `main/` All the stuff that will go in the main carousel.
		      - `board/` PCB images.
			  - `schematic/` Schematic images.
			  - `misc/` Miscellaneous images that will be added in the description.
          - `description.html` Description of the project.
		  - `project.json` Project description file.
